It is worth thinking about what to do next, perhaps I should meet someone who can help me with my job and tell me how to live in this big city. But, of course, I should not forget the principles of my home - you can't build happiness on other people's pain. I'm looking for a better life for myself, but I won't set other people up for it.",
